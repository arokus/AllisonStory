Today Charlie was walking down the street. It was very cold and very slushy outside. Charlie had not worn his snow boots, but he was really regretting that right now. In fact, Charlie was really regretting a lot of things right now. One of them was going to school in Wisconsin. Why had he chosen the cold over sunny California?
Because of his regret Charlie decided that help him feel better he needed something nice and warm. Just as he turn the corner he saw qq's and decided to go in. As he got in He saw a huge line of customers and wanted to leave, but he was already there so he decided to stay. After he got his order he decided to leave.
