Today Charlie was walking down the street. It was very cold and very slushy outside. Charlie had not worn his snow boots, but he was really regretting that right now. In fact, Charlie was really regretting a lot of things right now. One of them was going to school in Wisconsin. Why had he chosen the cold over sunny California?
